FIRST PROJECT 

Diabetes Prediction Challenge - Machine Learning Project (Python, Sci-kit-learn)

Overview
This project builds a machine learning model to predict diabetes status using basic health indicators.

Dataset
The Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset was used.
Target variable:

0 = Negative
1 = Positive
Methodology
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Data preprocessing and feature scaling
Model training using Support Vector Classifier (SVM)
Model evaluation using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report
Features Used
BMI
Glucose
Insulin
Age
How to Run Prediction
Ensure the model and scaler are saved in the model/ folder
Run:
Results

The model achieved approximately 75% test accuracy, with reasonable generalisation performance.
