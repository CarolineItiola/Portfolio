Diabetes Prediction Challenge - Machine Learning Project (Python, Sci-kit-learn)
Background - A mobile health clinic aims to improve patient pre-screening for diabetes 
using basic health indicators. 
Objective-Conduct Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover factors influencing diabetes 
risk. 
Develop a classification model to predict diabetes based on attributes like BMI, 
glucose, insulin levels, and age 
Project Overview 
The project uses the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset, which contains health measurements 
for several individuals. 
Train a classification model (using scikit-learn) to predict diabetes status (0 = 
negative, 1 = positive).
